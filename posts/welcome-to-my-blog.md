# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! Welcome to my personal blog where I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence, mathematics, and philosophy.

## What You'll Find Here

As a senior undergraduate student at KAIST studying Computing, I'm passionate about understanding the mathematical foundations of Generative AI and General Intelligence. In this blog, I'll share:

- **Research insights**: Deep dives into machine learning and AI research
- **Technical tutorials**: Explanations of complex concepts in accessible ways
- **Personal reflections**: Thoughts on learning, research, and the pursuit of knowledge

## My Research Interests

I'm particularly interested in:

1. **Generative Models**: Understanding how neural networks can create and imagine
2. **Mathematical Foundations**: The theoretical underpinnings of deep learning
3. **General Intelligence**: What does it mean for a machine to be intelligent?

## Stay Connected

I'll be posting regularly about my research, projects, and ideas. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of these topics!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something interesting here.
