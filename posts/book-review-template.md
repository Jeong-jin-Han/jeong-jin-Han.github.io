## Example: Short Review

**The Stranger by Albert Camus**

Camus's existentialist masterpiece follows Meursault, a detached French Algerian who seems indifferent to his mother's death and his own trial for murder. The novel explores absurdism and the meaninglessness of life in a universe without inherent purpose.

The opening line—"Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure"—perfectly captures Meursault's emotional detachment. This alienation from social norms forces readers to confront uncomfortable questions about authenticity and societal expectations.

While the philosophical depth is impressive, some readers may find Meursault's passivity frustrating. However, this discomfort is precisely the point—Camus challenges us to examine our own automatic acceptance of social conventions.

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

A must-read for anyone interested in existentialism, absurdism, or philosophical fiction. Short enough to finish in one sitting, but rich enough to contemplate for years.
